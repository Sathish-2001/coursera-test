                <p>
                   Chicken is the dead piece of hen or cock. We can make Briyani, Gravy, Chicken-65, 
                   Curry from chicken. Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. Owing to 
                   the relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle 
                   or hogs, chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the
                   world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.

                <h2>Fish</h2>
                <p>
                    Many species of fish are consumed as food in virtually all regions around the world. Fish 
                    has been an important source of protein and other nutrients for humans throughout history.
                    In culinary and fishery contexts, fish may include shellfish, such as molluscs, crustaceans 
                    and echinoderms. English does not distinguish between fish as an animal and the food prepared
                    from it.

                <p>
                    Crabs are prepared and eaten as a dish in many different ways all over the world. Some 
                    species are eaten whole, including the shell, such as soft-shell crab; with other species, 
                    just the claws or legs are eaten. The latter is particularly common for larger crabs, such 
                    as the snow crab. In many cultures, the roe of the female crab is also eaten, which 
                    usually appears orange or yellow in fertile crabs.
